# It's just a sharper knife ðŸ”ª

`knife` is like the `cut` command with the `-w` flag, it delimits fields with whitespaces, [any whitespaces].
That's it, it doesn't do anything more. If you need more customizable search or more bells and whistles, use dedicated
tools like `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, etc or the `cut` itself.

## Installation

To install it run:

```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/twolodzko/knife.git
```

 [any whitespaces]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/str/struct.SplitWhitespace.html
